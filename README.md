# ⏱️ Just In Time - Real-Time Patient Scheduling & Alerts

> **"Time is the most valuable medicine."** > *Just In Time* is a dynamic healthcare ecosystem that treats a patient's time as a priority. By replacing static, broken appointment slots with a living, breathing queue, our system calculates the exact moment a patient needs to leave their house, ensuring they arrive **Just In Time** for their consultation.

## 💡 The Problem vs. Our Solution
Traditional hospital appointment systems rely on fixed time slots, which fail to adapt to real-time delays caused by emergencies or varying consultation durations. This leads to overcrowded waiting areas and frustrated patients.

**Our Solution:** We synchronize patient arrival times with a doctor's real-time availability using **Object-Oriented Design**. 
* **🕒 Zero-Waste Timing:** Real-time sync between the doctor's office and the patient's doorstep.
* **🧠 Adaptive Logic:** Adjusts for emergencies and consultation variances instantly.
* **📡 IoT Driven:** Uses ESP32 hardware to detect room readiness automatically.

* **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)
* **Backend:** Java Spring Boot (REST API & WebSockets)
* **Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL
* **Hardware:** IoT (ESP32) for room status detection
* **Machine Learning:** Predictive modeling for consultation durations
